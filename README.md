To implement a distributed **MapReduce** system with a master-worker architecture, we will set up two programs:

1. **Master Program**: This will manage task assignment and track task status.
2. **Worker Program**: This will request tasks from the master, perform the assigned task, and report back.

Weâ€™ll use **Remote Procedure Call (RPC)** to facilitate communication between the master and worker processes. Below is a structured approach to solving the problem.

### **1. System Setup**

#### **1.1 Requirements**
- Python is the chosen language due to its support for RPC with `xmlrpc` library.
- We need two types of files:
  - **Master**: Handles task distribution, tracks task completion, and manages worker failures.
  - **Worker**: Asks for tasks, performs them, and sends results back.

#### **1.2 Components**
- **Master**:
  - Assigns tasks to workers.
  - Monitors worker progress (task timeouts are set to 10 seconds).
  - Redistributes tasks if a worker fails or times out.
  
- **Worker**:
  - Requests a task from the master.
  - Processes the task (like counting words in a file).
  - Reports completion to the master.

### **2. Implementation**

#### **2.1 Master Program**
We'll start by implementing the **Master** that handles task assignment and worker monitoring.


#### **2.2 Worker Program**
The **Worker** will ask for tasks, execute them, and send back the results.


### **3. Execution and Testing**

- **Run the master** on one terminal:
  ```bash
  python master.py
  ```
- **Run multiple workers** on separate terminals:
  ```bash
  python worker.py
  ```

### **4. Explanation & Monitoring**

- The **master** initializes tasks and monitors them. If a worker fails to complete within 10 seconds, the task is reassigned.
- Each **worker** independently asks for a task, processes it, and reports completion.

### **5. Improvements & Considerations**
- **Load Balancing**: More sophisticated task distribution could be implemented for large-scale data.
- **Failure Handling**: Currently, only task timeout is handled. Worker node failures should be monitored too.
- **Security**: Authentication and encryption mechanisms would be necessary for real-world distributed systems.
